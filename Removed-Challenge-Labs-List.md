# Removed Challenge Labs: 

Eariler to March-2023: 
> To support the Microsoft Azure role-based certiÔ¨Åcation and training courses, LODS has launched a dedicated collection of Challenge Labs to support Azure Administrators who manage cloud services that span storage, security, networking, and compute cloud capabilities. This collection is comprised of 57 challenges and contains over 34 hours of hands-on practice. NOTE: Before you begin, please ensure you have set aside enough time to complete each challenge as you will not be able to pause, save, or return to your progress. Each challenge may only be taken three times.

Microsoft has now removed the challenge labs from AZ-104 Now: So here is a curated list. In case if you find those please contact me on rjs.swarnkar@gmail.com:
